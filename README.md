# Marble Game
This is a simple game made with an [Unreal Engine course]() 

During this course I learned how to organize my blueprints, get rid of my spaghetti code and turn it into a clean code efficiently. Furthormore, I expanded on my Unreal Engine knowledge and was able to implement what I have learned in university alongside what I have learned online into this one, simple yet enternaining game.

### learned values
- Organizing and cleaning code.
- File structure.
- Creating and applying materials.
